# Real Time Clock

The Real Time Clock plugin adds the client time into your RPG Maker MV project and provides a couple of handy event triggers. There are three events that are triggered from the clock: one for when the minutes tick over, one for the hours, and one for the days.

The point at which the hours and days tick over can be changed by adjusting the plugins parameters. For example, setting the HourTickover parameter to 20 will trigger the hour event when the clock reaches 20 past the hour. Also setting the DayTickover parameter to 6 will trigger the day event when the clock reaches 6:20.

*Note: All times are in the 24 hour clock ranging from 0:00 - 23:59.*

The events follow a heirarchy and only one will trigger at once. On the break point of a new day, all three events should technically fire but only the day event will be triggered. The heirarchy is as follows:

*Day > Hour > Minute*
